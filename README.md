ChEMBL Database - ChEMBL is a large, expert-curated database that helps scientists find and understand chemicals that could be used as medicines. It links these chemicals to their effects on the body, the diseases they might treat, and how they interact with biological targets like proteins. Thus, it contains curated bioactivity data.
